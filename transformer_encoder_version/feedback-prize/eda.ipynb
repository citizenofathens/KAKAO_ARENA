The story is about how NASA took a picture of Mars and a face was seen on the planet. NASA doesn't know if the landform was created by life on Mars, or if it is just a natural landform. \",\n \"On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars. In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform \",\n 'I think that the face is a natural landform because there is no life on Mars that we have descovered yet ',\n 'If life was on Mars, we would know by now. The reason why I think it is a natural landform because, nobody live on Mars in order to create the figure. It says in paragraph 9, \"It\\'s not easy to target Cydonia,\" in which he is saying that its not easy to know if it is a natural landform at this point. In all that they\\'re saying, its probably a natural landform. ',\n 'People thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars. ',\n 'though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars. ',\n 'It says in paragraph 7, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin took a picture of Mars with his Orbiter Camera, that the face was a natural landform. ',\n \"Everyone who thought it was made by alieans even though it wasn't, was not satisfied. I think they were not satisfied because they have thought since 1976 that it was really formed by alieans. \",\n \"Though people were not satified about how the landform was a natural landform, in all, we new that alieans did not form the face. I would like to know how the landform was formed. we know now that life on Mars doesn't exist. \",\n 'Limiting the usage of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere. Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one\\'s daily life. While \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by\" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student. ',\n 'With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars. Why would they all agree, one might ask. Well, there are plenty of reasons. \\n',\n 'stress. ',\n 'It is no secret that morning traffic jams and 5\\'o\\'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rage and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all? Mother and media trainer, Heidrum Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly car-less community, claiming \"when [she] had a car [she] was always tense. [She\\'s] much happier [that] way\" (Source 1). If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say \"it\\'s a good oppurtunity to take away stress\" (Source 3). Just one day was enough to de-stress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does. The event \"[left] the streets of [Bogota] eerily devoid of traffic jams\" (Source 3), which goes to show how stressful it was everyday, with traffic jams a common occurance. No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them? ',\n 'the environment suffers greatly from the many car emissions let out on the roads. ',\n '\"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (Source 1). This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car usage. If that were not enough, \"transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions\" (Source 4). It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that. Even car-pooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be less cars out there, which is possible through \"more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work\" (Source 4). \\n',\n \", adding the last two reasons together makes for another very important factor in all of this: everyone's general health. Both stress and high concentrations of smog can do a toll on one's body and the reduction of cars, once again, helps to reduce this terrible down-sides to the easy transportation option \",\n 'If it must be described as \"emissions ... are choking cities\" (Source 1), then why not be a bit more concerned. Air pollution can affect those with pre-existing respitory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effient and well a person can function. Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other task-oriented location that many go to with the aid of a car. ',\n 'It is also worth noting that cities that have embraced a no car lifestyle such as Vauban or Bogota have generally improved as a community and have given back anything the newly car-less citizens may have been missing out on through saving them time and money. ',\n 'In Vauban, \"stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway\" (Source 1). This is not only much more cost-efficient, but also convienent. This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where \"parks and sports centers [] have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" (Source 3). Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well. \\n',\n \"Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.  \",\n 'Should computers read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom? ',\n 'No because, why should a computer know how your feeling? ',\n \"It wouldn't change the emotion the students feeling. It also wouldn't help with the students education. Its over all just a waste of time. \",\n 'The process begins when the computer puts together a 3-D digital model. There are 44 major muscles in your face that the computer has to detect. Eckman classified six emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He then \" associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles.\"\\n\\nFor example the frontalis pars lateralis muscle is above your eye which shows your surpried when it is raised.\\n\\nUs humans alone can identify facial expressions on peoples faces. If you look at a friend you can tell how they are feeling at that moment. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint the facial muscles percisely on the Mona Lisa painting. Dr. Huangs has new computer software it stores similar info as electronic code. He thinks there could be a different type of code to the painting. \\n',\n \"When facial facial expressions a made its about muscular action units. The school computer shouldn't have to know how you are feeling. What kind of problem is that supposed to solve \",\n 'This idea is nothing but just a distraction for school students. It also may detect wrong facial expressions. ',\n \"To conclusion computers in school shouldn't detect emotions of the students. I have proved my point on why it shouldn't be in school. I have given you several examples from the passage to prove this point. It shoudn't matter if the computer knows how your feeling.  \",\n \"I think that it wouldn't be valueable to have technology be able to read emotions \",\n 'the fact that its really easy for someone else to get into your phone or tablet through face reconition ',\n \"People use face reconition alot and it can be a quicker way to get into your tablets and phones or any other electronics, but people can easily crack into the electronic and take any personal infomation that they need. I mean electonic ability to read people's emotions is cool and all, and its a huge next step into newer tecnology for the future, but the fact that you know say you needed to be happy to get into your phone, some one else can act happy and, well unlock your phone. \",\n 'In paragraph six the article talks about how they could make different ads show if you were happy or frowning. That could be good but if your watching, like youtube or videos and an ad shows, your going to want to keep watching your video and not the ad. If a person is watching a show and an ad pops up and they smile, then it shows another ad that the person didnt want to see because they wanted to keep watching thier show. I think people would be angry if that happen, because not a lot of people like ads ',\n 'Ads can be good for promotion of products, but i think we all know when your playing a game on your electronic device that you want to keep playing or watching and not the ad. ',\n 'The reasons why i said that this would be unvalueable is because the reason of security,like anything could go wrong because everything in technology can be unexpected. thats why i chose the reasons I did. ',\n 'What is that thing on Mars? ',\n 'Well, some people believe that it was something made by aliens. I am here to prove that it was not. \\n',\n 'The thing on Mars first was photographed in 1976. It is a huge rock formation that resembles a human face. There are shadows that give it the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. ',\n 'Some believe that it is real evidence that there is life on Mars ',\n 'well it is not. ',\n 'On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the \"Face.\" The new cameras snapped a photograph that was ten times sharper than the original one. The new image revealed that it was a natural landform. ',\n 'Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the clouds, ',\n 'but in 2001 a newer image was taken ',\n 'This image was captured on a cloudless day, so there was nothing obstructing the view. This image also shows ',\n 'that the presumed face was a landform, and not the ancient work of aliens. ',\n 'So, in conclusion, the famous face on Mars was a natural landform. This is supported by the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001. The image captured in 2001 could also possibly see other objects if there were any. So, the face not a sign of life on Mars. ',\n 'Students around the world are forgetting more and more from their past school year, due to their long summer vacation. Because of this, many teachers are debating whether or not they should simply give students teacher-designed projects over the summer, or let the students design the projects themselves. ',\n 'summer projects should be teacher-designed ',\n 'easy plagiarism ',\n \"teachers' knowledge on how to deisgn and grade a project. \",\n 'When i was in the 6th grade, for fun, our teacher assigned the class to design a volcano that had to shoot up as far as possible into the air, made with paper mache, glue, and other accessible materials. There wasn\\'t much instruction on how to do the volcano, as long as we were the ones building it, and the idea/design was original. Most kids\\' volcanoes looked pretty amateur, with varying degrees of success. However, the kid whose volcano shot up the highest, was disqualified for copying his design and materials exactly from a project someone had shared on the internet.\\n\\nIf a student can plagiarize someone\\'s work from a project loosely designed by a teacher, then even more students can plagiarize a project that \"they themselves\" designed. ',\n \"Often times throughout middle school, my teachers would give the students each other's assignments to grade themselves. And afterwards, we would see in the grade book\\xa0that the grade changed because the students weren't grading the assignments the way they should have been. The student grading was meant to engage the classroom, but it turned into a showcase of how students dont really know how to grade the way teachers do. If students are unaware of how a project is supposed to be graded, they can not successfully design a project that tests whether or not they understand the material. \",\n 'Some people may say, \"but allowing students to design their own projects will allow them to focus more on their work during the summer.\" ',\n \"Whenever I'm given a summer assignment, I know for a fact it I won't even look at the assignment until maybe about a few days before the first day of school. Which would lead to me rushing a lazily put together assignment and a not so good grade. Giving students the opportunity to design their own assignments will lead to students rushing their projects, and justifying it by claiming that the level of quality meets the standards of their assignment. \",\n \"It is important to keep students' minds engaged over the summer break, so they don't feel completely disoriented the following school year. I know from personal experience that the break between school years has left me disinterested in continuing to learn and work for the next school year. However, giving students teacher-designed assignments will stimulate their brains and keep them focused over the break. \",\n 'Have you ever been bored in a class room such as your highschool english classes? Well do to a brand new algorithum made by Dr. Paull Eckman, creator of the FACS(Facial Action Coding System), you can finaly be exited about learning about greek and latin roots. This program can detect how you are felling and in what precentages ',\n 'In the following paragraphs they will talk about if we should or should not read students faces to make the classroom experience more enjoyable.

The spcifics of the smile are as follows she's 83 precent happy, 9 precent disgusted, 6 precent fearful, and 2 precent angry. This computer software known as the FACS looks adn all 44 major mussles and then makes a decison based on that. How can this be helpfull to schools. \",\n 'Now if you actualy like doing greek and latin roots in your english class you may not need this new technology, However you may not like another class like math classes ',\n 'If we start doing eveything on computers like all of our lessons for example we will probably need this to keep us from not falling asleep during the class. ',\n 'If we do end up adopting this new software into our computers it could make us have more fun lessons and make the classes end faster, well do to preception ',\n \"If the technology could be used with just a webcam then you could just look at your students face and see if they are bored or off task and make the lesson more enjoyable. We could just look at the precentages of the kids facial expressions like how they found out how the Mona Lisa's smile was mostly happy. \",\n 'In conclution we could make our childrens classroom experiences more enjoyable. Even if it is a little creepy to have a software that watches you for your whole classroom experience. But it mostlikely is worth it to make shcool more enjoyable for the kids in them. ',\n 'Do you really thing a land form could make a face ? To me that seems something is very unlikely. A planet that we do not look alike can make a face as a organism on earth? ',\n \"The photo isn't clearly shown as a face it just looks like a planets land form \",\n 'It may aslo be a feture that is only unique to this palnet like the moon has thousands of craders. I just feel as if Earth has all the water and green grass on it mayb Mars has these land forms instead. Also it might be like how people gaze at the stars or the clouds to see if they make an object or a human face. If you look closley you can see that the\\n\\n\"face\" has ridges or canyon. So maybe the ridegs/canyons made the land form that way ',\n 'NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face. They also believe it is an alien artifac ',\n 'According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth. They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years. \\n',\n 'In conclusion the \"face\\'\\' to me is still just a land form. ',\n 'Just because it looks as if it is something could not just be made out of a human face. If they had more evidence then it would be believeable but until then my opnion is still that it is a land form.      ',\n \"Being in a car is how we transport ourselves to and from places. Now what would you do if you had to give up your car. Yes, some people didnt mind giving up their cars but not everyone would be ok with this. We have gotten so used to driving cars that i don't know what some people would do if they had to give up their means of transportation. Its also another factored that what if someone had to drive a long ways, it would take them even longer to get where they're going. Its a very serious topic when you think of how much time one person spends in a car. \",\n 'Well Paris has enforced a driving ban to help clear the air of pollution. \"On mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.\" Many people, in Paris, were fined for driving on the wrong day.

',\n 'So, in the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions. ',\n \"After reading the article I really could'nt decide. When reading about the FACS the first thing that came to my mind was to use this technology on the faces of celeberties. \",\n \"Well it's because it would be fun to do so. In my opinion that's what it's most useful for in classrooms. \",\n 'Sure the teacher could use this technology to teach students about how advanced the humans have become but.. ',\n 'Imagine being a teacher and then one day you introduce the FACS to your students. What do you think the first thing they do would be? I think the first thing they would do is take selfies and let the FACS analyze thier face. Then they laugh at the results. ',\n 'See they are doing it for fun. ',\n \"This reminds me of disecting frogs in biology. Some students think it's useful for your education while some other students think it's a waste of time, a waste of life for the frogs and that disecting them in the first place is already digusting. But do they do this for fun. NO they don't. They do it to learn about the oragns of the frogs and the purpose of each organ. But is disecting frogs valuable? Yes in my opinion. \",\n \"So, no I don't think it's classroom valuable to use FACS. \",\n \"But that dosen't mean that you should not let them try it. \",\n \"Here's what the teachers should do. They show the students a picture of someones face. Lets just say for example Mona Lisa. The students will stare at the picture for about a minute carefully looking at every part of Mona Lisa's face. Then the students will decide Mona Lisa's emotion by rating her happiness, sadness, anger, digust or any other kind of emotions. Then after that the teacher uses the FACS on Mona Lisa's face to see if the results for Mona Lisa's emotions from the technology is the same as the results from the students. \",\n 'Human vs Technology there you go.    ',\n 'The study the ability of humans to read subatle changesin facial expressions, thast they appiled reverse correlation technique to reveal visual features that mediate understanding of emotion expressed by the face.

Movemment of one or more mucles is called an \"action unit\" Then Dr. Pual Eckam, creator of (FACS) Ekman has classified six basic emotions- happeniess, suprise, anger, disgust, feat and sadness. In the text it states,\"The soft wear is the latest innovatiobn from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institiute for Advance Science at the University of\\n\\nIllinois.\" Dr. Huag and colleague are experts at developing better ways fo humans and computers to communicate. The faical expressions for each emotion are univeral, observers Dr. Huang, even thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like smiling broadly).

',\n \"Have you ever ever been required to do a summer project that your not intreasted in? Certain schools in America require students to complete summer projects to ensure they are still learning over break. Students are often assined teacher designed projects. While most students complete these over summer projects many students don't due to lack of intrest in the assined topic. \",\n 'To improve student input schools should move towards student designed projects so students will be more intrested and and involved in the project. ',\n 'While a summer project is not something most students would like to do over there break, teachers could allow there students to choose a topic or unit to base there project on. ',\n 'Students can use this to there advantage and choose a topic they were intreasted. Students could learn and still enjoy working on the project. Students also have an easier time working on topics that they have knowledge on allowing them to complete there work easily. Students can take advantage of being able to design there own project and choose a topic or unit that they struggled on through out the year. Working on these weak points can strengthen your skills for next school year. Students can go back and look at past notes and worksheets helping improve there skills in that topic. ',\n 'Students being able to design there projects could allow the student to create something they enjoy doing over the summer with friends and family, rather then students thinking of it as another teacher assined project that is boring ',\n 'Instead they can create something that they think of as fun but still educates them. They could also use this project to study or learn upcoming cirriculum for next year. This would allow the student to get a head start on future units and topics. ',\n '\\nOverall schools that require summer break projects should move towards student designed projects over teacher designed ones. When students have the ability to choose from certain topics and units they can decide what is best for them. Using the project to work on material that they were intrested in through out the year and want to further research and learn about or use the oppurtunity to study material that the student had trouble with over the school year so that they can be caught up for next year. Furthermore students can create projects that will help them with future cirriculum for next year. In conclusion schools should use student designed projects because it allows the student to choose how they want to utilize the time for either further studying a topic, going back and reviewing areas they had trouble in or learning future topics for next school year.

For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face. most us would have trouble describing each others facial trit that makes us happy or worried. Yet Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo Da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emoitions. \",\n 'However the new technology is valuable by telling you how what are your human emotions. For example a classroom computer can show when a student is bored or getting confused. Also it can classified six different motions ',\n 'Therefore this New technology is valuable for the students in classrooms.      ',\n \"Almost every student knows the dread of going back to school. The easy and laid back summer fads out and suddenly it's back to the old grind. The sleeping in till noon goes back to waking up at six, bathing suits get put back in the closet, and the sun tans fade. Yet, almost every student can relate to the one thing that always keeps them tied to school during the summer, the dreaded summer assignment. It could be a book report or a math packet, either way it burns in the back of their minds while they cannonball into pools. It seeps into thoughts while\\xa0they try to fall asleep. \",\n 'If teachers gave students the opportunity to discover their own work, and maybe even a passion, students work would be of a higher quality and it might actually have them excited to go back to school. ',\n \"When someone decidedly does not like something, you can't force them to like it, no matter how hard you try. That is what it can feel like for students when teachers assign work that is not interesting to them over and over again. There is no way for every part of classwork to interest students, but teachers could make an effort to make the one assignment that no one wants to do over the summer, interesting. \",\n 'When students have the ability to decide what they will study in a project, they are more excited and more willing to get the work done. ',\n 'Having students choose their project will save both the teachers and students from the painful force feeding of information. ',\n 'Now, this assignment can not be a free for all, that would not be completely fair. There may be some students who go above and beyond while some may do the bare minimum and call it done. ',\n 'To avoid this scenario teachers could implement some sort of rubric or guidelines for what the student chosen project would have to include and how they will go about grading it. This way the playing field is level and everyone has the opportunity to succeed. ',\n 'A common issue faced with summer work is the student procrastination. Obviously no one wants to do schoolwork on their vacation so it is common practice to put it off for as long as possible and then rush the night before. Even if there was three months to do it! ',\n \"With a student chosen project, students may feel more inclined to do their work because working on something that interests them won't feel like such a chore. \",\n 'The end of summer is not fun for anyone involved, students and teachers alike. Why would we want to dampen the vacation with unexciting work looming over students heads the whole time. Students should feel excited to go back to school and be they should have something to look foward to sharing with their classes. It is common knowledge that doing work that is uninteresting to you lowers your performance and makes the work that much more of a chore. With student selected summer assignments we can prevent that and create a new wave of excitement about returning to school.\\xa0 ',\n 'In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", it tals about how scientest are working on new technology to overcome the chalanges of Venus and its complications.

In the beginning of paragraph three it states how a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide engulfs Venus. The clouds on this planet are also highly currosive with sulfuric acid in them. The planets surface averages about 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than on Earth. This concludes that Venus has the hotest surface tempreature of any planet in our solar system. Venus also has obsticals like erupting valcanos, earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes on the planets surface. \",\n 'With all these complications though scientest still are curious about this dangerous planet. ',\n \"In the second sentance of the fourth paragraph it explains that astronomers are curious because it may have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

One of them is inventing is a small vehical that resembles a blimp floating 30 miles above Venus's landscape. \\n\",\n \"Now this doesn't get the scientest what they want exactly what they want \",\n \"because due to the planets atmospher light doesn't peneatrate very well making it difficult to observe ground conditions.

They are also recyclaling old ideas from the 1800's, they are trying to use a computor that does calculations,but theinvention uses gears and levers, meaning that it doesn't require any electricity to work. \",\n 'Scientest are working hard to accheve this goal to explore this harsh mystery planet.

Some students are already tired from school and might not want to participate in any other activity because they have to wake up early for school and have to do school work really early even though science\\xa0say that the human brain starts working correctly when it's ten in the morning so that means the human brain of a middle school\\xa0might not work so well at six or seven in the gosh darn morning. \",\n 'I disagree with the principal that every student must participate in an activity because not everyone is sporty, want to stay inside and do the yearbook or serve on the student council.

',\n 'Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable ',\n 'so students can study and understand how the artist felt when he or she painted on the canvis. ',\n 'They could be happy, sad, surprise, angery, disgusted,and afraid. ',\n 'The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a good thing, because not only students can the device but middle age people can use the device too. ',\n 'paragraph 1 said \"She\\'s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.\";and how we know that? you may ask. The FACS \"Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS\" witch was stated in paragrah 3; they said all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles and when moving of one or more muscles is called an action unit. ',\n 'Paragraph 4 said \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal\" and that means every you move your expressions change. They also gave an example they said like not smiling as broadly. They can move and mix emotions in da vinci\\'s masterpiece witch the Mona Lisa useing the FACS. Dr. Huang\\'s new computer software cantanes similar anatomical information as electronic code. ',\n \"So lets say you was trying to see all of your mom's emotions in one picture, \",\n 'by useing FACS you can move rotate and mix emotions to figer out your mom emotions, and to have students and teacher do that thats cool ',\n 'So yes, its valuable. ',\n '\"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.\" -Nick D\\'Alto. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is very amusing system that can read how a human is feeling. The thought of a computer software being able to decipher what I\\'m feeling is shocking. ',\n 'I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom is valuable. ',\n \"There are many reasons why I agree with the use of the FACS. For instint, technlogy would be able to identify how you feel about what you're learning, \",\n \"it'll make you a more emotional person \",\n 'it will help you stay on task. ',\n 'I think the FACS has a good chance of changing the future in a possitive way. ',\n 'The FACS was desinged to to recognize six everyday emotions. This would be helpful when a student is confused or does not understand what the teacher is trying to teach. ',\n 'The system could then modify the classwork that the student is working on. With more practice the computer could then change the difficultiness of the assignment according to how the student feels. For an example lets say a gentelman is stuck on a math problem. The frustration that the gentelman is showing will be seen by the computer. The computer will then help the gentelman by modifying it or infroming the teacher where he is struggling. This will better his education and help out more when students are scared to ask for help. ',\n 'The positive effect that the FACS has on the students is another reason why it will be vaulable in classrooms. ',\n 'In the passage it says,\" According to Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expreess emotions, but also may even help produce them. (\"Putting on a happy face\" actually works!)\". This proves that it has been proven by experts that this system could help spread positive vibes. \"Whoever thought that making faces could receal so much about the science of emotions!\". ',\n 'Finally, the FACS could help identify when students are bored and are not paying attention. ',\n 'This will help a student pay attention and not stay behind. The solution to this would be to modify the infromation to be interesting or less difficult for a student. I assume that this would decrease the amount of missing assignments and improve grades. This will be better fro the students to gain knowledge. ',\n 'In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms for students. They will help improve their interest in topics at school, help the students understand better, it will help students be more possitive, and finally is will have a big impact on all of us. The Facial Action Coding System would be a new way of gaining more knowledge. It will help students and teachers understand eachother better. Overall this would be a positive impact amoung us all. ',\n \"How much value would come out of going to Venus? Scientists have tried many times to study Venus. Unfortunatley, they've always come out as failures.

Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet. \",\n 'The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit. ',\n \"The author of the article does mention how difficult it is to study Venus by bringing up the planet's harsh atmosphere in Paragraph 3 \",\n 'Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus.

',\n 'Technology has been upgraded throughout recent decades, and most recently, technology has taken a different approach. The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, but is this really a better way to communicate? It comes down to the facts. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Everyone has different ways of expressing emotions, and not everyone feels the same emotions. Thinking that a computer could possibly detect your emotions is a bit silly, to some, and valuable to others. So what makes it silly to some? You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face, you can talk with them in person. ',\n \"Having physical contact is very important when it comes to emotions, using a computer to detect, sounds a bit far-fetched. Schools have teachers, and school counselors, so that students can talk express how they feel. Some people don't see why this feature could possibly be useful in a classroom. \",\n \"There are many issues going on in the world, much worse than trying to figure our expressions. So, why aren't we using this tchnology, and these smart people to work on something more important? Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, what would you need it for \",\n 'Human communication is very important, using a computer to detect how you feel is simply a waste of time, in some opinions. Making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotion. ',\n 'On the other hand, what could the Facial Action Coding System be useful for in classrooms? Students may be able to use this feature in physiciatry studies ',\n \"Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling. \",\n 'However, a computer cannot feel, cannot have sympathy, and cannot understand many things about humans. ',\n 'Reaching the final conclusion is up to you. Is a computer being able to identify your emotions useful in classrooms, or not?

The possibilities are endless to any activity that you could join at your school. Extracurricular activities are important to every school. Though every school has different activities, each and every one of them play a key role. Students may wonder why their principal would make them have to stay after a long day of learning. Students may think that extracurricular activities aren't interesting, but they may not realize how many options their school has to offer.

For example, if someone joined the SCA then they would be involved by organizing school dances and events. Giving ideas to the student council is another way to be a part of your school. Say you thought that the dress code\\xa0needed to be adjusted, you could join a club and talk about it. These clubs can be used to spread awareness for bullying.

Another example is if you join an art club you will have something to talk about because you both will like art. Sometimes it can be hard to open up to people and make friends but trust me doing an activity will help that tremendously. When I first joined JV soccer I was really intimidated by all the big kids, but then I talked to them and they seemed really nice and talked to me. This goes to show that extracurricular activities can help you make friends that you would of never made if you didn't join that club. \",\n 'Another important reason to join a club is that you could actually really enjoy it.

If you try photography for the first time you could like it so much that you do it again next year. Also, you could join the tennis team and realize that you're really good at it and end up becoming a famous tennis player. However, not everyone is going to like the choices that they have. Well, our school could have an option that students get to create a club that they would like. This solves the problem because other students could like the same thing as their peers so they would want to join that club. Someone could want to create a club for ROTC and another student may want to be in the military so they join that club. Instead of joining a random club because you have to, try to actually find one that you enjoy. There are many choices for students because the principal want everyone to be able to do an activity that they like. \",\n 'Extracurricular activities provide lots of opportunities for students. You will make lots of memories and friends from joining these clubs. Many students have joined activities and enjoyed being involved so they kept doing that same club every year ',\n 'However, some students may find it rude to be forced to do an activity. We have homework and activities outside of school ,so why do we have to stay at school for an extra hour? In order to make everyone agree with the idea of having to participate in a club we have to fix the problems. ',\n 'Yes, students have homework to do, so we can have each club have a specific day of the week to prevent students from staying after everyday ',\n \"Another issue is what if parents can't pick up their child? \",\n 'Then in that case the school will provide transportation from the school to the students bus stop ',\n \"There is no reason why students shouldn't join clubs.

Now the students will not be bored in class,neither will they be confused because the system would be able to recognize it and change it ',\n 'The progam still has alot of flaws ',\n 'but when is solved hopefully, we can have them in our classrooms in the future this could be the most valuable \"teacher\" so far it would be of a great value for schools.  ',\n 'In Nick D\\'Alto\\'s article, \" Making Mona Lisa Smile\", the author suggests that Dr. Hung\\'s new facial regonation would be useful for many things including using it in a class room to read stusdents\\' emotional expressions. ',\n 'I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions. ',\n 'In his article, he uses the Mona Lisa as an example, and I personally think that it was a good example to help show her conveyed expressions. ',\n \"Dr. Hung invented the Facial Action Coding System, which helps identify the emotions displayed on the human face,and paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. \",\n 'If this technology was used in a classroom setting, I think that it could be used to help teachers understand if some of their students are enjoying the lesson. Or it could possibly be used to tell when the students are lying to their teachers. The Facial Action Coding System shows the six basic emotion that are associated with the movements of ones facial muscles. The basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology can also identify mixed emotions. ',\n 'Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday. ',\n 'For example, a friend could probably tell how you feel by looking at your face. But some people might have trouble describing what each facial expression means. Dr. Hung had oserved had aritists like leonardo who had studied human anatomy that had helped them to paint human emotions. Similarly, Professor Hungs Facial Action Coding System is able to be electorically stored with some information about human anatomty and emotions. ',\n \"Lastly, there are fourty-four major muscles in the human face. For example. a muscle called the obricularis oculi pars palabraeus is the muscle that makes the crow's-feet shape around your eyes. Experts can tell a real smile from a fake smile by the way your mouth is moved. Facial muscles can help produce emotions, by the movement of your muscles. \",\n 'With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, I think that teachers could easily figure out the emotions that their students faces are conveying. ',\n 'This coding system seems to be revelotionary to me because of it can decipher emotions and it could help many people such as students, teachers, and even the government. ',\n 'In conclusion, I personally think that with the help of this technology teachers will be able to read into their students emotions better. Also, teachers would be able to tell if students are lying to them. The value of this technolgy would be able to help them read the facial expressions of many people with diasbilites who have trouble conveying emotions. I beleive that is this type of technology were to be used in a classroom that it would be a great help to many teachers.

Generic_Name looked confused and slightly angry. \"Yes Generic_Name, you do have to join a club, it\\'s a requirement for the new year.\" said Principal Generic_Name. Generic_Name looked down than looked back up at his principal, \"Great.\" Generic_Name said sarcastically. Generic_Name spent that school day looking around and asking about the different clubs the school offers. While Generic_Name was looking, one club caught his eye. The gaming club. When Generic_Name was out of school he always played video games, it was his favorite pass time! Since the gaming club was the only club that sounded remotely appealing to Generic_Name, he signed up. His first day in the club, he was skeptical, but he quickly realized the club was far better than he expected. 2 weeks passed since Generic_Name joined and he already made plenty of new friends and learned about many new games that he grew to love. ',\n 'Schools should make it a requirement for all students participate in a extracurricular activity ',\n 'it helps students meet new people and make new friends, ',\n \"it can introduce students to something they've overlooked or have never heard of before \",\n 'it can increase social activity among\\xa0students. ',\n 'having students join and participate in an extracurricular activity can help them meet new people and make new friends. ',\n 'Joining an extracurricular activity such as a club or a sports team can be very beneficial to students. Having students join clubs can help shy students talk to new people and make more friends. Even someone who is frequently talkative and already has a lot of friends can meet and talk to new people who share the same interests as them in the club. Having friends who share your interests is something that every student wants, and joining an extracurricular activity can help students achieve that. It was only Generic_Name\\'s first day in the club when he met two people who would later become his best friends. \"Hello,\" said a voice Generic_Name has never heard, \"My name is Generic_Name.\". Generic_Name looked at Generic_Name and shook his hand, \"Hey Generic_Name, i\\'m Generic_Name. Nice too meet you\". The person standing behind Generic_Name introduced himself next. \"Sup Generic_Name. My name\\'s Generic_Name, I\\'m Generic_Name\\'s Friend.\" he said. \"Nice too meet you as well Generic_Name.\" Generic_Name replied. Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name quickly became good friends because of their similar interests. ',\n \"requiring students to join an extracurricular activity can introduce students to something they've overlooked in the past, or something completely new. \",\n 'Students have their interests, they either like something, or they don\\'t. Something might not come off as interesting to them at first glance. They might only start to realize something is interesting to them when they take another look. If schools do an event that shows off each different club, students will get that \"second glance\" that they need. For example, my older brother wanted to join a club in high school. He looked through the website and found that nothing sounded interesting to him. He decided to look again, this time actually reading the descriptions of each club. He eventually found the art club. He read the description, thought it sounded interesting and signed up. ',\n 'ubs and sports are very social activities. If they\\'re in a club, students are basically required to socialize with others. This for the most part is a very positive benefit, allowing students to talk to others who share similar interests with them. Students may even spend time outside the clubs with the people they\\'ve met. For example, my cousin Generic_Name\\'s mom, forced Generic_Name to join a club. She said Generic_Name wasn\\'t socializing enough and spent to much time time on his computer. Generic_Name asked around to find a club that was preferably easy. He eventually found the computer club which aligned\\xa0with his interests, and his want to spite my aunt by \"playing on computers\" in his club. Despite that my aunt got her wish and Generic_Name became more social outside of school with his new club.\\n\\nGeneric_Name had spent his entire 10th grade year in the gaming club. Now that summer was approaching for the first time in his life he felt sad about leaving during the summer. Generic_Name never thought by joining a club his perception about school would change this drastically. The next day Generic_Name and his club talked about meeting up over the summer, everyone was ecstatic about the idea. Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name all have met up before outside of the club before, but the entire club has never got together like this. School ended just as fast as it started and the day quickly approached when the club would get back together again. ',\n \"schools should make it so all students have to participate in an extracurricular activity such as a club or a sport because it helps students make new friends and build relationships, it can introduce students to something they've overlooked in the past, and it can increase social activity among students. \",\n 'According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world ',\n 'The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable ',\n 'it would allow teachers to know when students become confused ',\n 'are being dishonest ',\n 'or are depressed and possibly having problems at home. ',\n 'In the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. ',\n 'Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,\"\\'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\\' Dr. Huang predicts. \\'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\\'\" (D\\'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student. ',\n 'School behavior is a big part of a students education. If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly. Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment. ',\n 'The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers. ',\n 'In the excerpt, the author writes, \"To an expert, faces don\\'t lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling politician or celebrity isn\\'t being truthful,\" (D\\'Alto). In this quote, the author tells the reader about some facial muscle clues that allow experts to tell if a famous figure is being dishonest. These are some of the same facial clues the FACS looks for. ',\n 'Finally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. ',\n 'The machine can detect six different emotions, including sadness. This could prove useful when dealing with distressed students. \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" (D\\'Alto). This quotes tells the reader about the emotions the machine can read. ',\n 'Just before the bell rings to dismiss students for year, teachers are struggling to keep the attention of students when explaining their summer assignments for the break. The students know that the summer assignments are important, but their attention is on the bell that declares summer vacation. Summer assignments are designed to ensure that students continue their intellectual journey over breaks. Both teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects accomplish this goal, however, one of the biggest challenges is deciding whether teacher-designed projects or student-designed project would do a better job at accomplishing this goal ',\n 'The best way to ensure that students continue learning over break is to assign teacher-designed projects. ',\n '\\xa0Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have a better understanding of the material, ',\n 'the project will be less stressful for students ',\n 'teacher-designed projects will prevent misjudgment of students by teachers. \\n',\n 'Teachers should design summer projects because they have a better understanding of the material they are trying to teach. ',\n 'They also tend to have a clear understanding of what they expect from students for the projects they assign. By assigning teacher-designed summer projects, the teacher can guide the students to learn what the teachers want them to discover. They also provide a more specific rubric so the students know exactly what is expected of them. For example, AP Biology has a lot of material that needs to be covered in just one year. To solve this issue, they assign a teacher-designed summer assignment that consists of an introduction to each unit learned throughout the year. This way, students are prepared when going in depth with all of the concepts in class because they already have a grasp of the topic learned during break. By assigning teacher designed projects, teachers can guide the students to ensure that what they are learning and exploring can help them perform better in class. ',\n 'Another reason teachers should design the summer project, is that the project will be less stressful to students overall. ',\n \"Although teachers are expected to be unbiased, they will always have personal beliefs that may clash with a student's beliefs. During student-designed projects over the summer, students do not know the personal beliefs and preferences of their teacher because many students have not spent much time with their future teacher. Student-designed projects are often stressful in this situation because students do not always know the teacher's expectations. Students do not want to receive a lower grade on their project because of the biases of the teacher. Students also feel anxious because they never know if their project is unique enough to get a good grade and if the teacher will find it as interesting as the student. For example, many science classes require students to conduct experiments in a field they find interesting. Not only is this assignment very vague, but it is also unfair. There are many different ways a student could take this project and some projects require more time and effort than others. For example, testing to see the effects of personal care products that get into waterways on marine life requires a lot more time, effort, and materials compared to testing which brand of paint needs the least amount to coats to adequately cover the walls. Both of the projects meet the criteria, but one project may be considered better than the other by a teacher. This gives many students anxiety because they never know if their project is good enough. Student-designed projects are too stressful and often end up diminishing the quality of the student's summer break by giving them anxiety. \\n\",\n \"Some teachers may argue that student-designed summer projects are an outlet for students to show their creativity. They believe that students can showcase their intellectual level by completing\\xa0student-designed projects and the teachers can get a better understanding of their students' beliefs and preferences through student-designed projects \",\n 'However, student-designed projects are not always the best reflection of the students and their work ethic. ',\n 'Many students go on vacation during the summer for extended periods of time and may not always be able to do what they actually wanted to do. Many students visit family in places that do not have the internet or adequate resources to complete the project that they wanted to complete. For example, if a student wanted to test the effects of personal care products that get into waterways on marine life, it would be impossible for them to do so if their relatives lived in an underdeveloped and remote village in India because they would not have access to the materials they need. ',\n 'However, with teacher-designed projects, students can work with their future teacher to plan ahead to complete the assignment or complete a different assignment entirely depending on their situation. Students would not be forced to settle for something that is not a true reflection of their work ethic because of their circumstances. ',\n 'Teacher-designed projects are the best way for schools to ensure that students continue learning material for classes during break without causing anxiety in students or misjudgment of students by teachers. Summer projects are meant to help students but student-designed projects can sometimes harm students instead. Every student should be allowed to spend their summer without stressing about how they will be perceived by their fellow classmates and teachers the next year. Summer projects should encourage students to continue to learning while also spending quality time with their family and friends during their break. ',\n 'Growing up in a constantly changing environment, students have had to learn to adapt to the world around them. In school, students are taught to be open and ready to learn, while still facing the ups and downs in the journey of childhood to adulthood. Students make close bonds with their friends and even a few choice teachers. Students choose to whom they share their emotions with and at what time they wish to do so ',\n 'Emplimenting a computer system in schools that is capable of reading a students emotions is inappropriate, lazy, and dangerous. ',\n 'This technology is incredible. It\\'s capable of easily figuring out what someone feels right when they\\'re feeling it. Empathy is an intimate ability one experiences with another. Most people have the ability to sense others emotions, \"For instance, you can probably telll how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.\" There is a prominent understanding in the natural world regarding emotions ',\n 'Sometimes not every one wants to be figured out and displayed to their peers. ',\n \"In school, students are faced with one major task: to learn. Teachers are faced with the task of teaching. A teacher's job is to engage students and the students job is to stay engaged with the teacher. \",\n 'Emplementing facial reading teachnology is innappropriate and dangerous to the privacy of students, and it threatens the basic principles school systems were founded upon. ',\n 'Furthermore, this technology could be used in the wrong situations. The article stated that a smart school computer could tell when students are getting bored or confused and change the lesson, \"\\' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\\' Dr. Huang predicts. Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\\'\" This example puts teachers in an awkward position. Letting a smart, facial reading technology teach students would mean the teachers aren\\'t teaching ',\n 'Giving power to technology is complacent, instead of working with people to improve learning habits or teaching methods, adults would be taking the easy way out. ',\n 'Some might argue that these computers might be a useful tool for counselors in schools ',\n 'This is a valid argument, but this also compromises the position of school counselors. ',\n 'Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection. ',\n \"The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction \",\n 'In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author suggest that studing venus is worth while even though their are extreme dangers while doing it. ',\n 'The author supports this idea in the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" by the similarites to earth making the dangers worth while ',\n 'the testing on diffrent pieces of equitmeant to withstand the extreme climate of venus, ',\n 'the life they believe was once their making it a plave they want to explore. ',\n 'The author in the article explains many resons in which he or she thinks the dangers of venus are worth it for science ',\n 'one of them being the similarities which they can see from far distance the planet has to earth. the author says Venus is often referred to as the earths twin due to the size, mountain like, and believed to have many oceans and waterways making venus very simlar to the earth. with venus being the closest planet as well to the earth having a closer distance to venus from earth. \\n',\n 'Though Venus is concidered the twin to earth it has many diffrent features making it dangerous for scientist to explore the planet. One of these extreme dangers is the diffrence in climate as said in the article Venus reaches upwards of 800 degrees Fahrenheit easily melting most metals making it hard to recieve samples from the planet. ',\n 'Though they have tested many new products in chambler ith simlar climate to venus finding new ways to hopefully find more out about Venus. ',\n 'lastly the author also talks about how Venus most likely had life on the planet similar to that of earths ',\n 'scientist are interested in finding out more about this even though many dangers are included in this task. Finding new ways to make sysems in which can be sent to Venus is difficult but found early computers with physical componets might be the key to their succsess in finding out avout Venus past. \\n',\n 'In conclution Venus has many similarities to earth, but due to the extreme conditions of Venus it makes it hard for scientist to explore and find out more about the planet, even though it is the closest to the planet earth. These dagers and risk are worthwhile due to the simlarities the earth shares with venus, the new test of equtmeant in which can withstand these climates, and the life in which they believe use to be on Venus all make exporing Venus, even with dangers worth the time. ',\n 'Students often moan and groan about summer projects that their teachers assign them to do over summer break to assure they continue learning over the period they are not in school. The projects most of the time, have a set rule book to follow that was issued by the teacher and it makes the project boring and not enjoyable for the students to do, basically being a burden the students have to over come during their relaxing summer break. ',\n 'These projects that get assign should be more student-designed ',\n 'students can be more freely creative with their own ideas ',\n 'it will be more enjoyable to do for them, ',\n 'they can continue learning in a more ideal way. \\n',\n 'Having the project be more student-designed, students would not have to struggle with limitations and can be more creative and use their own ideas for a better outcome of the project. ',\n 'Teachers often put a strict instructional guide or manual on what to do and what not to do, during the assignment and limits what students can do and blocks any originality. However, having a student-designed project will unleash a wave of ideas and flow of creativity between each student that would not normally be received from a common project. The whole outcome of the entire project will be changed drastically because of the freedom students will have on their own projects and in which, in the end, will satisfy them. During research projects, teachers also frequently\\xa0limit the student on what they can look up and use. If the project was student-designed, students can freely look up and use what interest them and learn about something that will make them more engaged into the project. They can not be held by idea blocking rules that will make the project disengaging, they can have creativity run free throughout the entire assignment and it will show. Overall, a student-designed project will make a more standout project due to the original ideas students will leave throughout the project. ',\n 'The sound of a project over the summer break already sounds boring and a headache of a time for any person in school to do but students will always be more engaged in a project that will allow their own unique spin on it and uses a piece of mind from them. ',\n 'The thought of a project is always a dreadful one that all, will have a hard time to get them self\\xa0to do it but a student-designed project will make it at least, a more enjoyable experience. Students can utilize their brain and knowledge to make it a project to remember and have fun while thinking of an idea to blow teachers and fellow classmates away once they return from break. For example, a science fair allows students to show a unique idea with experiments, this causes fun competition\\xa0and a enjoyable process on how the project is going to \"wow\\' the judges. Speaking of competition, if the project would also have an incentive to try to achieve the best project, students would even be more thrilled. The student-designed project will show a big amount of their own ability to the assignment and make them strive for the number one spot. This would heighten the accomplishment of the project and give them a sense of excitement for their own unique project to compete with classmates. In the end, rather than having a normal boring project, students who have a chance to design their own project, will have a lot more fun and excitement\\xa0in the process of doing the project, in which, will still allow them to learn and not interrupt with their fun and relaxing summer break. ',\n \"Projects also have a based way of learning, a way teachers think it's best for our generation to learn, but they are not our generation, they do not know what is best for us, they just think it; by allowing students to freely design their project, they can learn in their own ideal way. \",\n 'When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them. Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path. \\n',\n \"Projects being put out during summer break will always be a boring and overbearing thing to complete and in some cases even ruin summer break for them overall just to learn information that teachers assign. Having the project be student-designed, however, will change the entire assignment in all, giving more creativity, better pacing, more enjoyment, and a better learning experience for students all around, it will benefit them rather than a teacher-designed project. All projects, even ones put out over summer break, should be student-designed because the outcome will have more uniqueness with student's ideas, the project overall will be more fun, and students will learn in their own learning way.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \",\n \"Would you enjoy your summer if you were required to do some project that didn't intrest you? A project based off of something not to your liking or one that is so boring it would put you to sleep? \",\n \"Here's why students should be allowed to come up with their own school project to make sure they continue learning over summer. \",\n 'Students would be more likely to want to continue learning by doing their own designed project because they will do it on a subject they want to know more about and intrested in ',\n 'the project would be more likely done if choosen by them ',\n 'it wont feel as required if its student choosen. ',\n 'Some people might think it should be teacher based ',\n 'some students wouldnt like the topic or the teacher would want them to include certain things students might not know how to do or would like to include in their project. This will also give them less freedom of choosing there style of project. Teacher based projects would also be more educational based off of things they teach and wouldnt intrest students and it would be msot likely not turned in by the end of summer. ',\n 'Students would do a project on a topic they want to know more about and intrested in. ',\n \"If the project were to be teacher based, most students wouldn't be intrested in it, therefore, some students wouldn't want to do the project and will have the lack of wanting to learn about something that doesn't intrest them and make it a chore. Making a student choose a topic for their project would, make them choose something they're intrested in and they will most likely have a project ready to turn in at the end of summer. Student would also complete the project with more detail instead of not having any at all. All the projects would be different subject and more unique letting students choose so teachers can make sure students learned. \",\n \"Some students have summer jobs or go travel to different location's \",\n \"When student's are given the choice of choosing their own school project they will have less of a chance of forgetting that they have to do one or forgetting what they have learned about \",\n 'This will also give them a chance on choosing what style of what of project they want. They could do it on paper or poster or power point and many more. Students coud also base it off of the schedule they have or the days that are free. ',\n 'Student based projects would be more likely done then teacher based projects. Students would do them off of things they are interested in and subjects that catch their attention. They will do it around there time frame and in any style they want. doing it student based will have students educate them selves about things they enjoy and love to do on daily bases and teachers will have something turned in to them by the end of summer. ',\n 'Summer projects are given to students so they can continue to learn and not fall behind in the coming school year. But would it help if the summer projects are created by teachers? Well yes, teachers have been teaching and making projects for a long time and they would know what they are doing. As a high school student I could prefer that my teacher makes the projects verse some student who not much of an expert on the topic.\\xa0 ',\n 'Summer projects should be teacher-designed ',\n 'they have more experience, ',\n 'the project can be less confusing, ',\n 'the project can give the student an insight of what the class will be like. ',\n 'With so much experience and training they would know how to design a project that will allow the students to continue to learn through out the summer. For example, I am taking AP chemistry and there was a summer assignment. This assignment was created by the teacher and it was easy to comprehend\\xa0and do. This made my experience with working on the project much more productive and less time consuming. ',\n 'Many of the projects that I have done were mostly teacher-designed and they were easy to understand and finish without too many hurdles. If there were to be any confusion it would be much easier to contact the teacher about a question than a student. When there are less mistakes in the project it would be more time effective and one would be able to finish the project faster. \\n',\n 'This would help students to be prepared for the coming year and they would also know what to expect. For instance, when I had received a summer project for AP statistics as I was doing the project I was able to understand more about what statistic is and how the class work would be like. However, if a student were to create the project it might not have given a picture of how the class would be like through out the year. ',\n 'schools should have summer projects that are designed by teachers. This way students would be more benefited\\xa0due\\xa0to the teachers knowledge on the topic. When the teachers do create the project there will be more clarity on what the student should do. The students will also be able to get a feel of the class in the coming year.\\xa0 ',\n 'Luke joined the program.

Thomas Huang, ge tge beckmqn institute for Advanced Science at the University of lllinois, working in collaboration with the Prof. Nicu sebe he are the Universitycof tge Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at the developing vetter ways for the human and computers to communicate. And they was talking about the calulate emotions like a math homework? and how can they computers the recongnize of the subtle facial movements. And they have the humans use to express how we feel. And they was staring making comuter constructs a 3-D computer nodel of the face; all the 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles. And movement of the one more muscles is called an\"action unit.\" Than Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of tge FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). And theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only Expresses emotions, but also the may even help produce them. May happen because they unconsciously imitata another person of the facial expressions. And whoever thought of that making faces could reveal so much abouf the scepience of the emotions. ',\n 'There is a saying that goes as this; \"You can\\'t make everyone happy.\" One would typically use this saying if an action they make improves the situation for one person, but creates a worse situation for another. However, if Professor Thomas Huang\\'s new \\'Facial Action Coding System\\' proves to be what he says it can be, then Huang believes that there actually is a way to make everyone happy, even in the school setting. ',\n 'The implementation of technology able to read the emotional expressions of children in the classroom is valuable for both the teachers and the students. ',\n 'Inside a school classroom, there is no doubt that it is hard to please everyone. Therefor, when a student becomes disengaged from the lesson, they often become bored and fall behind in the class. After-all, all students learn differently, so it is inevitable that some of the students will become disengaged. However, with his new technology, Professor Huang predicts that the \"classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson\" ',\n \"With this technology implemented, anytime a student starts to fall behind during the lesson, the computer could make slight adjustments to the teacher's plans to help redirect the student back on track. \",\n 'It is common knowledge that the more a student falls behind in a class, the harder it becomes to catch up, which in turn makes the student fall behind even more. It is a viscious cycle that all stems from a day of not paying attention that could be averted by this technology ',\n 'This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner. In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could \"even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (Paragraph 7). Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer. In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own. The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help. Now imagine if there was a computer in that class ',\n \"Once it sensed the troubling expressions on the child's face, it could flag down the teacher and alert him or her to the students problem, resulting in the child getting the counceling he or she needs. \",\n 'The amount of improvement a classroom could see if this technology was implemented correctly would be immeasurable. The system could prevent students from falling behind in class because they cannot relate to how the teacher is teaching, and the technology could see through fake expressions hiding more troubled thoughts. With this sort of system, it may actually be possible to \"make everyone happy.\"    ',\n 'The \"Facial Action Coding System\" is technology that can be used in the class room because some people can\\'t figure out how good or bad someone is feeling. ',\n 'Teachers will be able to know if the student is learning or eithor not paying attention or sleeping in class. ',\n \"It'll be easier for them to know what's false and what's true expression in their situation they could be in. \",\n \"In difference in the situation students can't understand someone's expression. \",\n \"Thanks to the technolgy now it'll be easier to figure out students emotion or anyone. \",\n 'The article states, \" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.\"\"The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.\" ',\n 'Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. ',\n 'In my opinion it\\'ll be a better way to learn/read better on our emotional expressions because you\"\\'ll have more information and could know more about everything you want or need to know about the expressions. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. We humans perform this same impressive \"calculation\" every day, for instance, you can probably tell how a person is feeling simply by the look on their face.

The streets would be a lot safer, especially for adults that have children. Children get snatched up in what? A bicicyle? No, a car. ',\n 'it would be a lot safer for kids and teenagers to go out and have a good time and not worry about a lot going around them. \\n',\n 'We already have more pollution problems then we need. ',\n 'People just dont care anymore about how or where they live and they will just throw any kind of trash they want on the ground. So driving cars just helps the people already littering, the cars are just polluting the air we breathe. So instead of us Americans not giving a crap about what were doing to the wonderful beautiful planet we live on, we should start, and help, but not driving the things that pollute are air. ',\n 'In a result of limiting car usage, Mr. Goldberg says \" Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role.\" So this means that by approving it this year, there will be more public transportation then people driving there personal cars. Getting rid of cars would decrease a lot of the problems we have now. ',\n 'Some of you might think, \"well what if we work for a living and need to get to work?\" ',\n 'Well, you can awlays WALK to the public transportation area. Studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This leaves us wondering, \"Has Obama passed peak driving?\" ',\n 'Is it gonna make us get lower in obesity, make the streets safer, and stop the pollution of the air? Getting rid of cars will decrease a lot of issues that we have in the world today, so getting rid of or decreasing the car-usage is a positive, not a negative.

It doesn't because of teachers who give students hard assignments to do over summer break. Summer projects are a fun way to engage students in learning over their 2 month break. \",\n 'it should be student-designed ',\n 'let students gain leadership skills, ',\n 'let them express their creativity. ',\n 'One of the many needed traits in life is leadership and is gained from setting a goal and reaching it. Leadership is an important trait because it shows your character and is necessary in a workplace. An example of a student-designed project is the Science Fair. The Science Fair allows students to choose a project of their own and complete it for a grade. The Science Fair is a perfect example of successful student led projects which also help gain leadership. Another example of a student-designed project is the MYP assignment. The MYP assignment is assigned to 10th graders, in Virginia, and are supposed to make a project from scratch. Their project is allowed to be anything they want and in any format which helps the students gain leadership skills when they finish. Important traits like leadership are gained from student-designed projects ',\n 'A student that loves cars will try more on a project they designed about cars then a teacher telling them to design a project about Anatomy. Also, if a student knows a lot about a specific topic then it would be easier to write about it compared to a topic they have almost no knowledge of. For example, if I know almost everything that has to do with Poker then I would rather write about that instead of computers which I know nothing about. During the summer, many students will be on vacation with their families. The summer is the one time students get a long relaxing break and are free from work. Summer projects assigned by teachers can be stressful and confusing at times which is why it should be a student-designed project. Students designing their own project would allow them to work on it at their own time and do it at a comfortable pace. Creativity is an important skill which students should be allowed to express. ',\n 'Teachers-designed projects would allow students to have a baseline of where to start from. One positive of teacher-designed projects would be they are professionally designed (by the Teacher). ',\n \"However, many teachers assign projects without thinking of the difficulty or issues that students could face. What if a student doesn't know anything about the topic? Well the teachers expects them to learn it themselves which is another reason giving students the ability to choose for them self is a good idea. A project designed by the teacher can take longer than they expect if students aren't fully educated about the topic. Consequently, this leads to students wasting more of their summer from trying to learn about then complete the teachers project. \",\n 'student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher designed projects. They both have pros however the positives of student-designed projects outweigh the teachers. Projects designed by students allow them to gain leadership skills, and let them explore their curiosity or creativity.   \\xa0 ',\n 'Dr. Huang stated that his computer can identify a persons feeling just by scaning them. By the way it look the computer can verify a person experssions by the way that they look even thou some poeple in this world can understand expressions but techology is change and now it can nearly tell human emotion. But yet the differences here are that the computer can see emotions or no emotions at all. ',\n 'Well the step to take in order to see if a person is showing emotions it would muscular action units. For the instruction 1&2 will determin that techology can tell which from which like a smile canbe tested by a computer or a real person. A machine can tell the difference. ',\n \"We need to look at the prons and cons cause a person can tell if a person is showing any emotion is how they are useing their mouth's muscular actions such as smiling or frowning. Telling a force one a real smile can be que trickey but a computer can tell the differences. \",\n \"Remember in elementary school you used to get summer\\xa0reading logs and checks on books you were 'required' to read during your break? Some students never had a problem with these types of assignments because they loved to read any chance they could get. Unfortunately, there were also the\\xa0kids who would dread reading and give up after ten minutes or pretend they did the entire assignment. Though at this age, it really didn't matter whether or not you did the reading logs, it was just a little nudge your school would give you to do summer learning. However, when students reach higher levels of school, especially around high school, the requirement of summer projects is actually a requirement. Lots of students complain that it is unfair to do assignments over the one, long break they receive, but depending on the class subject it is for, sometimes these projects are essential. \",\n 'Schools must be aware that if summer projects are always going to be required, the assignments should be student-designed ',\n 'students will have more urge to do them ',\n 'sometimes the projects can interfere with summer plans, making it troublesome to get work done. ',\n \"Summer is the only substantially long break that students receive off of homework, assignments and tests. Through the months of August until June, school does not cease. Almost every week, robotic-like students must wake up early Monday morning, suffer through eight hours of sitting and listen to a teacher go on about something like, why did the War of 1812 happen, how to dissect a frog, or solve for x. Five days are filled with this repeating schedule with two days to spare, and in my experience one of those days is set aside for weekend homework. No matter how much someone loves school and learning, eventually they need a break. Summer is the time to cut loose, hang out with friends, travel somewhere you've never been before and relax. Almost everyone has seen in a movie how students throw their books and papers up in the air as soon as that last day bell rings. Imagine receiving a final project the last day of school, requiring students to turn in on the first day of their next year of school. Now if that project was teacher-designed it might require a student to: 'write an eight page essay on the effects of propaganda use in your society' or 'create a tri-fold\\xa0and 3-D display of a past, indigenous, tribe's village'. Just picturing these assignments make some people cringe. However, if summer projects were student-designed, people could create a piece of work that interests them and hopefully enables them to put in more effort on the assignment because it wouldn't feel as much like a school task \",\n \"Student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives, peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative. Students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display', and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals. \",\n \"During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far. Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space. In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer. One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas. Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project. If one was to receive\\xa0a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done. For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records. No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado. \",\n 'Student-designed projects allow students to create a work period and timing schedule for when doing the assignment works best for them. ',\n 'Some, especially teachers, might argue that having students design their own summer projects will lead to the minimal work necessary and a poorly done assignment. Teachers might say that students are primarily focused on their summers and just having fun, rather than getting something done that could benefit them in their next school yea ',\n \"However, if the project is required for school, that typically means it is graded. Students won't try to do the least amount work possible just to save them time, if that means they will earn a D on the project. They will start the year off poorly. The overall effect of the project will outweigh how much time and effort is put into it. \",\n \"Overall, student-designed projects would be more beneficial for both teachers and students because these types of assignments create a unique idea of who you are as a person because it shows individual interests. If a project was deemed boring and just based on facts, teachers would be more likely to receive non creative and possibly plagiarized work. Students wouldn't care to try their best because this one task is taking time out of their long awaited break from school. In addition, student-designed projects also allow teachers assigning them, to have a sense of who their incoming students are, based on their projects. \",\n 'Students across all age groups look forward to the last day of school, the day summer vacation begins. From the endless memories summer entails, to the exciting, fun experiences, summer vacation is one of the most beneficial times for students. For many high school students, teachers assign summer assignments or projects that relate to a class they may be taking in the upcoming school year. These assignments tend to require an expansive amount of time and also tend to be rather ineffective. In the summer students want to fill their time with exciting activities that they would enjoy. We live in the age of self exploration with some the most inquisitive students, but we still conform to the age old summer assignment system. ',\n 'In a new modern classroom setting, students should have the liberty to design their own summer projects ',\n 'because students are more inclined to learn when they have the liberty to decide their work, ',\n 'the process of self exploration is the key to molding successful minds. ',\n 'When given a task you do not enjoy, most people do either of two things. The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work. Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student. ',\n \"Some of the most successful people are regarded for their fame and success due to self exploration. In Benjamin Franklin's famous autobiography, he shares his experiences through self exploration. Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today. Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for. From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration. \",\n 'The overall benefit of students having their education in their hands, outweighs the potential negative repercussions. ',\n 'Some may predict that students may slack off when given the opportunity to create their own summer projects. ',\n 'While this is possible, when a student is pushed, surprising results follow. In addition, giving students that necessary push is how we can create a brighter future. ',\n 'Hi!

',\n \"In the story it says that it uses you face to tell what going on or something. They say that they can tell if it is a real smile or a fake one by your muscules. The muscles called orbicularis make croe's feet around your eyes, but then a fake smile, the mouth is streched sidesways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius. Then is said that if an ad pops up and you are happy then the facial action coding system is going to think you like it then more and more are going to be poping up. Sense it said that it can tell eveything just by four face. The rusults won't be right. For people that wear makeup the facial action coding system is not going to get the right results. You might have a facial problem or something wrong with you muscles. That you wouldn'd be able to simle perfectly.

Most likely people are not going to feel safe. What if someone gets to hack you computer. They are going to be watching you all day, everyday. \",\n \"Sense it said that it will cost a lot of money to get it. I won't be fair if some schools have it and if some don't. \",\n \"The facial action coding system will be hard to get. Some school can just get enough for the basic's.

',\n 'For students, summer projects can feel like a lot, summer break is supposed to be filled with fun times and vacations while projects are almost the exact opposite. Removing summer projects all together isnt an option, ',\n 'so when it comes to the question \"should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed\" teacher-designed projects reign supreme, as it benefits both the student and the teacher in multiple different ways. \\n',\n 'As a teacher, your main job is proving students with a learning experience that will help them grow as people. Having a student design a summer project would not be nearly as powerful as the impact a teacher-designed project would. ',\n 'Teachers are well informed and know a lot more than most students and because of this it is their responsibility to provide a student with a project rather then have them create one themselves. This is especially reinforced in younger children, such as grades k-6, as they still need a lot of direction and having a student-designed project would not be as viable or coherent as a teacher-designed project. ',\n 'Teachers have it difficult sometimes, as they are trying their best to provide students with a learning experience, but teachers also deserve to have their job be a little easier ',\n 'Creating a teacher-designed project as opposed to a student-designed one, would be far easier to grade and create a rubric for ',\n '. In student-designed projects you have a lot of variety and no one follows a central guideline, however in a teacher-designed project, you can maintain the variety but also contain a set of rules that benefits both the students and teachers, as the students have more clearly defined rules to guide and provide structure to their projects. This also benefits the teachers, as they can easily grade the assignment and provide a fair grading experience. ',\n \"Finally, teachers have everyone's best interest at heart when designing projects. Teachers will always design something challenging and beneficial to the students education. \",\n 'Students, especially younger ones, cannot be trusted to design a project that would be as beneficial as a teacher-designed project. Students often take shortcuts or the easy way out and while sometimes this can be beneficial to the students and their education, it is more often harmful then doing it the right way and teaches them to be lazy. A teacher-designed project on the other hand, would be designed with the thoughts of providing an enriching experience to the student and hopefully making them a more successful and educated person. ',\n 'Teachers play well informed, and important roles in a students life while they develop, and education is a very big part of student development so, projects should be designed with a teachers interests at heart. Because of that, when it comes down to it, teacher-designed projects are generally more helpful, easier, and responsible then a student-designed project would be. ',\n 'I feel like I am for the value of this use of technology, because you can calculate other peoples facial emotions and your facial movements. ',\n 'I feel like if you can calculate emotions on a persons face you could understand that person better and what there feeling. ',\n \"You could do a 3-D model of the face and put in all of the muscles just like a human has on their face.\\n\\nYou could understand if their happy, suprised, or even sad. Your frontalis pars lateralis muscles ( above the eyes ) raises your eyebrows when your suprised or scared.\\n\\nYour emotions could be all over the place.\\n\\nYou could have certian facial expressions.\\n\\nFor an example, you could have your fear look. You could've saw something that you're afraid of and have a fear look. The software could even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.\\n\\nI know that everyone has different facial features, but some people have the same facial expressions.\\n\\nI personally think that we should all have different facial features because no one can be the same and no one is perfect. \",\n 'This technology could observe how our face is formed in the future. \\n',\n 'This new technologyis the same technology for making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or surgery. \" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication \" that Dr. Huang had. Computured need to understand that, too \" said Dr. Huang.\\n\\nYour personal computer can\\'t handle the complex of the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa\\'s smile. ',\n 'You sometimes has to ask yourself\\n\\n\" Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?\" and \" Can your lab partner recognize which one? \" So I think that this technology is a good idea.        ',\n 'In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even with the dangers on the planet. ',\n 'Venus is the sister planet to Earth but the surface of Venus presents a challange to any living thing. Venus is also called the \"Evening Star\" despite it being a planet.\\n\\nVenus is a planet that the most like Earth but we bearly studied it because we\\'ll have to get on the planet to do so. Venus has around the same density and size as the Earth but Venus\\' surface is 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus\\' Atmosphere is dangrous as well with 97% of it being carbon dioxide and the clouds made out of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Many people may be wondering \" If our sister planet is so in hospitable, why are scientists even thinking about any further visits? Astronomers are really fascinated by our sister planet because how close to Earth it really is, Venus even has valleys, mountains, and craters just like our Earth.\\n\\nFor future visits NASA has came up with an idea to has hover crafth that floats 30 or so miles so we wouldn\\'t have to step on the boiling planet. ',\n 'Venus is a worthy pursuit because the more we know about our sister planet the more things we get to do with it. ',\n 'In the article it talks about a facon mars that has appeared on Viking 1 while looking for a place to land. ',\n 'The face is a natral land form ',\n 'because thats like saying our land forms were made by aliens and thats why we have mountains, valleys, and plains. ',\n 'In the article it says \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural land form. There was no alien monument after all.\". ',\n 'The article also states about the face on mars\"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" ',\n 'Another quote that proves this is a land form is \"Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the Face on mars.\"The photo of mars is a land form because it says right there in the passage it is a lava dome and it is about the same hieght as the face on mars. ',\n 'In paragraph 6 it says \"although few scientists belived the face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia bacame a priority fo NASA whe Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.\" ',\n \"In this essay, I'm going to talk about the new softare, that is called the Facial Action Coding system, which can help the computer to knows if we are sad, happy or angry. Putting the example of the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's called Mona lisa. \",\n 'this software is a very good idea, for the teachers and the students too. ',\n 'The software can calculate \"emotions\" like math homework. Just recognizing the subtle facial movemets that persons use to express how they feel. ',\n 'The new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising application for a variety of industries ',\n \"It's a new software that can recognize emotion, and it's the last innovation from prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague Are experts that are trying to do better ways for human an computers to communicate. This process begins when the computer does a 3-D model of the face; creating at least of 44 major muscles making it move like human muscles. Eckman has classifies six emotions ( happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddnes) Associating each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example: your muscles above your eyes rais your eyebrowns when you are surprised. The software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. \",\n \"A big example is The subject of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona lisa. Da vinci studied anatomy to thelp them paint facial muscles for paint special emotions \",\n 'This subject is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how this can computer can do. Your PC can\\'t handle the use to decode Mona lisa smile. But this invent can write down simple instructions that \"encode\" differet emotions. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. ',\n 'This software makes the computer could recognize when a student is bored or confused, then it could modify the lessons, like an human ',\n 'It can indicate the difference between a genuinie smile and a forced one. To finish with some cientifics conclusions and understand better your boddy. According to the Facial\\n\\nFeedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not ont only express emotions, but also may help produce them. A example is when a drama coach tells to his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage because empath might happen when you see someone else expressions. ',\n 'In conclusion a think this is a good idea, because you can problably know when a friend is feeling just looking on his face, so imagic that a software in your computer can know that ',\n 'May 19,1950 9:30 A.M.\\n\\n\"Wow, I Just had a dreamed about when I started to become a seagoing cowboy, man those were the doy days.\" \"Well time for breakfast\" I said.

Well we need you all to go on a little trip back to Europe to help some People out over there becuase some the Students over there needs some adive about some of the jobs you did back in 1945. \"Ok, sure thing\" said most of the Seagoing cowboys. but some of the rest asked \\'what, why??\" Well the ship leaves the next day so pack some of your things you well need.\\n\\nMay 21, 1950 Noon\\n\\nDon and I got on the Ship and into a bunk room. \"Well just like old times\" said Don\\n\\n\"yup\" I said back. \"Well I am going to explore the ship do you come?\" I asked. \"How about we unpack out things.\" Don said \"Ok\" I said.\\n\\nJune 2, 1950 9:00\\n\\n\"there is a thunder storm out side I wonder if lighing is going to hit the ship?\" I asked. The odds of that .. BOOOM!!! Then the alarm came one and said everyone to get to the life boats.

',\n 'In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents ',\n \"because In the text it states that venus is actually a planet and venus is the second planet from the sun. The text also states that venus is simple to see from a far distant. Finally, it says that numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study in etc. If you look back in paragraph 1& 2 that's where I got all the information from to support my answer. \",\n \"In conclusion studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because if you just reread everything in this passage it's basically telling you alot of information about venus. If you look back in the passage in read paragraph 8 it's giving you information about venus it says that venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The last in final thing is that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So that basically tells you everything about why studying is a worthy pursuit despite for venus. \",\n 'There are many dangers that come along with studying planets. Along with the dangers, there are also countless benefits to learning more about different planets. In the passage, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author addresses the point that Venus is worth taking a closer look at and focusing on, no matter the dangers it could put one in. ',\n \"Although many people believe that the author doesn't support this idea well, the author provides researched evidence and past experiences all throughout the passage to support this idea. \",\n 'In, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author includes well researched evidence to support the idea that Venus is worthy of studying further. ',\n 'When explaining NASA\\'s ideas on sending humans to Venus, the author states, \"NASA\\x92s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" This provides evidence that shows what a solution is to avoiding some of the difficulties that occur when trying to explore Venus. The author was able to support his idea throught the use of NASA and it\\'s research. The passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" This factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential. Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well. ',\n 'The also supports his idea of studying Venus depsite the dangers because he includes past experiences that make this idea stronger. ',\n 'When explaining past explorations to Venus, the author states, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" Facts that have been presented that occured in the past help the author support his idea that there is reasons why people should look into further studying Venus. These past facts present the idea that Venus once looked like Earth did, and if that is true, there are reasons why it should be looked into further. ',\n 'The passage later explains examples of NASA\\'s approached to studying Venus when the author says, \"Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.\" The idea of looking back on past resources to help the studying of Venus would help the process. This past project is a key tool that helps support that Venus should be studied even though it can be extremely dangerous. Using past experiences such as the ones included helps support and grow the authors idea. ',\n \"Ultimatley, it is understandable why one would believe that it isn't smart to look into studying and experimenting with Venus; however, the examples of the researched facts and past experiences help to support the authors idea that despite the dangers, Venus is worthy of studying. There may be many dangers that come along with studying different planets, but based off the evidence the author provided, Venus has avoidable ways to make it safe to study. \",\n 'As the end of a school year comes to a close, the summer is just beginning. Many during summer use it as a time to have fun and take a break from school. Some schools though require students to complete a summer project to ensure learning continues throughout the year. This can help to make sure that the student mind is awake and ready to learn when the start of the new school year begins. ',\n 'The basis for summer projects to assure continuous learning should be student-designed ',\n 'creative projects would be produced ',\n 'it would give students an opportunity to take control of their education. \\n',\n 'During the school year, students go from class to class completing the required work to excel. In most cases, this requires sitting through a lecture followed by an activity and homework. All of which are teacher-designed. For this reason, summer projects should be student-designed. ',\n 'Student-designed projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education ',\n 'Students would learn the responsibility of completing a project without a teacher telling them the process they should follow. The students would have to research and create a project based on something that they are passionate about. For example, every student has their own interest such as baking, rocketry, and architecture. With student-designed summer projects, each student can complete their own individualized project based on their own interests. As to where a teacher-designed project the student has to go with what the teacher assigns. If the teacher is interested in types of frogs, students would have to complete a project based on the interest of the teacher. Student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education. \\n',\n 'When a teacher assigns a project, there are strict guidelines on how the project should be completed. To combat the harsh guidelines, a student-designed project would create more creative projects. ',\n \"For example, if there are 20 students in a class with one teacher and the teacher assigns a project, there will be 20 of the same project that return because of the guidelines that the teacher established when creating the project. But if every one of the 20 students got to design their own project, there will be 20 different projects that come back to be presented. This will happen because the students will feel more personally connected to their project. Students won't feel as if it is a project the teachers gave them but rather something fun to do over the summer. Having a summer project that is designed by an individual, the teacher, for a group, the students, will create a detriment\\xa0to creativity. \",\n 'Some may argue that if summer projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers could regulate and prepare the students better for the upcoming school year. ',\n 'This may be true, but considering that throughout the normal school year teachers design and assign work to students, it would be more beneficial to give students the opportunity to learn how to take charge of their own work. ',\n 'Continuing to have teachers dictate the types of projects students complete year round will not prepare them for the world.\\xa0A student-designed project would prepare students better for the world. ',\n \"Once the students enter the world, there won't always be a teacher telling them how to complete the task assigned to them. Giving students the opportunity to experience independence over the summer is a perfect way to prepare them for the world. Preparing students for the world out of school is more important than preparing them for a few weeks in the future when school starts. \",\n 'Schools that require students to complete a summer project should make the projects student-designed. Student-designed projects would cause for more creative projects compared to teacher-designed projects, and it would give students the opportunity to take charge of their education. Having summer projects to insure students continuous learning is a terrific way to enhance a students education. But done incorrectly, it can cause a student to dread school more. A well executed summer project would be student-designed, where the student gets to decide on their own project based on an interest of their liking. Making sure that students are positively active in their education is crucial to developing a well rounded individual. ',\n 'intro: Today ill be telling you the pros and cons about having this technology in our schools from counslers being able to tell whats with the student to invading the privacy of what we humans have to preventng suicide and to be able to maybe stop someone from commiting suicide or knowing someone is going through depression. ',\n 'body: so me personally think this would be some great technology to have in our schools ',\n 'espically for consoulers so say someone is really sad and depressed but they are to scared to open up about how they feel or whats going so you put the computer on there face and it shows they are depressed sad and scared well now you know how your student is feeling ',\n 'so then you cheer them up and work to make things better you dont know it but you just saved a life because who knows weather or not that student was about to comit suicide or say someone was threatned and they will not tell you that so they act like there fine but you put the computer on them and it shows that they are scared now you know they are scared and can try to work with them to open up ',\n 'but from other people perspectives i can totally see how this is a total invading of privacy because we all have secrects and we dont want people knowing if were depressed or sad and alot of people dont like to communicate or open with anyone and also what if things get passed around about you being depressed the generatin today are bullys so i can see someone making fun of someone for being depressed. ',\n 'conclusion: inconclusion i think it would be some great technology to have in our schools just think about how many lives we can change or how many lives we can save by just knowing how the person next to you is feeling it would save a lot of time trying to get the person to tell you whats wrong when you can just take a picture of there face so yes i do think it would be great because itll make life better, you would save more time, and you could change alot of lives and save alot of lives with this type of technology.

During games there can be drinks that you can have there is mostly water so that can heal you up and get your energy back.\\n\\nThe activities can be thery relaxing and a really good sport to join like if you like to run and exersise just join wich ever sport. The best one is most likely track because in track you can run alot. Football can be hard at most of the time you can go against tall poeple and really strong people the way how you can be like them is just train more and exersise more.

',\n 'Across the nation, nearly 98% of schools have offered extracurricular activities for their students, but less than half of that 98% have mandated participating in one. In many schools worldwide, extracurriculars have been known to both help and hurt students - they can lead to staying up late making up for lost time, or they can lead to winning awards and even scholarships. ',\n 'I believe that all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. ',\n \"mandating that students participate in after school\\xa0activities could improve kids' work ethic. \",\n 'a study titled \"Extracurriculars and Students\" by Professor James Wood at UVA proves this. Wood found that 65% of students who participated in extracurriculars said they enjoyed the additional challenges that were presented to them, and actually continued to work harder and challenge themselves not only in their education, but also in the workforce. This means that teens and kids who entered after school\\xa0clubs and sports teams worked harder and were able to learn how to overcome obstacles and challenges. This also goes to show how students that entered extracurricular activities did indeed improve their work ethic. In general, I think you\\'l find that this is important because it shows how adolescents were able to benefit from after school\\xa0activities. ',\n 'requiring students to join extracurricular activities could help students get into better colleges. ',\n 'a statement released by Harvard University said that 80% of colleges look for (and accept) students who participated in one or more extracurricular activities. To put it simply, after school\\xa0activities have been known to assist students in getting into better schools. This relates because it shows how kids and teens who entered after school\\xa0activities could manage getting into excellent colleges and create a better future for themselves. This matters due to how it shows that extracurriculars can broaden the horizon for students. ',\n \"It's actually been shown that clubs and teams could improve a students' health. \",\n 'A professional from Johns Hopkins said in an interview, \"...Students who participated in activities\\xa0after school\\xa0were reported to have a better attitude, more motivation in and outside of school, and possessed an overall healthier lifestyle than their peers who did not join any extracurriculars.\" In other words, adolescents who joined activities\\xa0after school\\xa0tended to be in better condition than those who decided not to participate in any clubs or join any sports teams. This displays how students have been able to thrive and even better themselves thanks to extracurriculars. Overall, I think you\\'ll find this important because it shows how kids and teens can greatly benefit from after school\\xa0activities. ',\n 'some might argue that students should not be mandated to take part in extracurricular activities, and say that teens may already have a \"full plate\" and thus become stressed ',\n 'A statistic from the Teens and Mental Health Welfare Society revealed that 48% of students who participated in after school\\xa0activities reported an increase in stress levels. To put it differently, close to half of the kids they talked to felt stressed due to their extracurriculars. This also demonstrates how a few students are actually pressured by their after school activities. Ultimately, extracurricular activities may stress students. ',\n \"While that might be true, there's no denying that after school activities can also teach kids to lessen their stress by learning to budget their time \",\n \"In fact, I personally was able to learn how to budget my time between school, family, friends, and extracurriculars. While I did\\xa0have a lot on my plate at first, my extracurriculars like sports, newspaper, and a few of my other hobbies enabled me to learn how to equally set aside time to complete all of my tasks in a timely manner, and still have time to relax. To put it in an alternate way, my after school activities were able to teach me an important skill that I'd be able to use for many years to come. You'll see that this shows that, truly, extracurriculars can teach students how to budget their time effectively. Ultimately, my extracurricular activities taught me an important life skill that could benefit me in many area of my life. \",\n \"In the end, I think that we should mandate participating in extracurriculars, as it could improve kids' work ethic, assist students in getting into good colleges, and even keep them healthy. Imagine a school with no after school clubs or teams offered to students; kids would be bored, unhappy to go to school with no chance to socialize or get active, and, most importantly, no chance to broaden their horizon and truly reach their full potential. \",\n 'Do you remember the summer projects that you had to do during summer break? Even now as fewer places require summer projects for all class,they are still an important thing for both students and teachers. They allow both so see how the other is either by teaching style or how they did on the content. ',\n 'The summer projects should be teacher designed ',\n 'it gives the teacher a chance to gauge the students academic level ',\n 'base it on what they will be learning that year ',\n 'and learn the learning style of students. \\n',\n 'Some say that student designed summer projects are better because they allow the student to pick something that they find interesting and that they understand. ',\n 'And while it may be good that the student is interested in the topic they are working on it sort off defeats the purpose of the project. Because the projects are suppose to be a introduction into the next year and a way for the teacher to learn about the students ',\n \"A student who is knowable able about history may design a project about Ancient Egypt,but if they already know the topic,they aren't learning anything. And while having the students create the projects may allow for more originality in the type and topic of them. That dosen't give the teacher the view of the student that they are meant to give teachers. Most students will design the project if given the chance to be easy so that they can have a good grade to start the year out. But that dosen't let the teacher see their strength and weakness,and the puts them at a disadvantage because the teacher wont know were the need help till it might be to late. If a student knows they have an English timed writing in Ms. Generic_Name class when they get into school,and they get to pic the book they analyze for it. They will pick and book probably that is on the easier side and that they understand. But if they are assigned a book by Ms. Generic_Name, she can see what skills they need when they do the writing. \",\n 'Teacher-designed summer projects allow teachers to gauge students academic level on various topics. ',\n 'The teacher can create different problems bases on different levels of understanding to see which students get what level. This allows them a more direct view then viewing grades or passed assignments because the students may have improved since that was done. Once the teacher can see what academic level the students are on it allows them to create curriculum\\xa0that allows everyone to understand and be successful during their class. If Mr. Generic_Name has a majority of people in his algebra 2 class that dont understand functions,he might spend some more time on the basics since a majority of the year will be using functions of some sort.\\n\\nIt also allows them to see who might need extra help in a subject and who can do it by them selves. ',\n 'eacher designed summer projects also allow teachers to give a glimpse into the years curriculum. \\n',\n 'Students can get a glimpse into the curriculum of the year from teacher designed summer projects because they can insert preassesment questions to get a handle on prior knowledge or have questions that tie ideas from the previous year into the new one. For example,Mr. Generic_Name could put in a questions about the cold war to see what people know. If a majority of the class has an understanding they can spend less time on that during the year and more on areas they are more shaky on. English and Math teachers can have problems were they have student uses old methods to solve new types of problems. This allows them to see if they need to spend more time on the basics before moving on to more advanced topics. ',\n 'Teacher designed summer projects in addition allow teachers the ability to see the students learning style and learn them. ',\n 'Teachers can see the learning style of students by including different types of questions bases on different learning styles. In the projects,they design they could included questions that appeal to visual learners as well as topics that appeal to mental learners. In math and science,they can included different ways of getting to the solution to see which way the student do the best on. This allows the teacher to create assignments that cater to the students. Since every batch of students is different this allows the teacher to change their curriculum to fit the students they have this year so that they can leave successful and ready for what ever next. Not all years are going to be the same, Ms. Generic_Name might have a bunch of auditory learners one year but the next she has a bunch of tactile learners and if she designs her projects to look for that. She can plan accordingly and change her style a little so the students still leave her class successful. ',\n 'Those are some of the reasons schools should have Teacher designed summer projects. Schools should have their summer projects be designed by teachers because it allows the teacher to gauge students understanding of principles and topics,allows introduction of new material,and learn learning styles. All schools that do summer projects should allow Teachers to designed them because that will help the year go better for both the teacher and student.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0  ',\n 'What the author was suggesting when he was saying venus is dangerous but a worthy pursuit.

They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? ',\n 'There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, ',\n \"First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. \",\n 'By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that \"face\" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that\\'s when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars. ',\n 'After scientists did a little research on their own, \"The Face\" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. ',\n 'How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform. ',\n 'Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. ',\n \"What's the difference its just a camera \",\n 'Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. ',\n \"Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars. \\n\",\n 'So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.            ',\n 'Creativity is the heart of our current society, when given the opportunity those who have the ability to think outside the box create unimaginably beautiful things. In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill set\\xa0of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? ',\n 'Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed ',\n 'its helps students learn to become more creative ',\n 'helps prepare them for the future. ',\n 'Students usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it ',\n 'If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them ',\n 'It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing, ',\n 'By letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new found\\xa0abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it. ',\n 'When teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested. It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity ',\n 'Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it. ',\n 'It could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. ',\n 'Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across ',\n 'When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in which\\xa0they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it. So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves. ',\n 'There is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future. ',\n 'Making extracurricular activities mandatory for students is not a valid rule that should be enforced. ',\n \"I don't agree that all students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity, \",\n \"whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done \",\n 'most of the students already do an out of school activity ',\n \"students shouldn't be forced to do something that they dont want to do. \",\n \"Just because they didn't take part in the chess\\xa0club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity. \",\n \"What if you dont have time? Most students already do an after school\\xa0activity like sports, or a youth group. Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school. So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos. Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too. For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one. If you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity. \",\n \"Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do. \",\n \"Students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not,and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things,and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory, so I don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity. \\n\",\n 'In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author describes the new technology facial Action Coding System or FACS which allows a computer to pick up on what you feel like and how you are feeling. ',\n 'I claim that the use of FACS in a class room enviroment could have used but mostly believe it is not a valuable resource in class. ',\n 'One reason why It is not a vaulable resource is it only programed to read six basic human emotions which are Happieness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. ',\n 'The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading. ',\n 'Another reason why it is invaulable is that a human is already prepared to read another persons emotions because it is a task that is already done each and everyday. ',\n 'Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet. ',\n 'Another person could say it is vaulable to help students and keep them entertained in a lesson and switch it up a bit. ',\n 'Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work ',\n 'but the problem being is that a program so complex like that requires so much code and algorithms that it requires a beffy computer to run so you would need to make multiple servers capable of holding that much information not only that but the school would have to divert much more of their budget toward stronger computers ',\n 'Dr. Huang states Your home Pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode smiles\" This saying from Dr. Huang proves that a PC for home use is not strong enough for this program so what makes you average home pc different from a school one other than filters put on the pc which reduces preformance but the worse thing that could happen is what if the power happens to shut down or go out do to a surge that program requires power to run so that is also a big problem. ',\n 'In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit. The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power.

Never stopping them from doing so. \",\n 'Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all\\n\\nGeneric_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities. ',\n 'I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter ',\n 'because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students ',\n 'tremendously decreases the time that a\\xa0student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them. ',\n 'rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. ',\n 'To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them. ',\n 'rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. ',\n 'At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called \"Generic_Name\\'s Work Zone\" or \"WWZ.\" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name\\'s Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be.\\xa0That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them. ',\n \"I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student's energy and can negatively impact a student's health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact. \",\n 'Giving students summer projects keeps their brains functioning. Some schools require that students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. ',\n 'summer projects\\xa0should be teacher-designed ',\n 'they know the content, ',\n 'have more resources ',\n 'have more experience. \\n',\n 'All teachers know what content they will be teaching giving them an edge to designing summer projects for students. ',\n \"With an understanding of the content they will able to create projects that will be beneficial to the the students. Moreover, the teacher can plan summer projects that include information that the students will learn throughout the school giving the students a head start. For example, a math teacher might give his or her student a math related summer project which will cover topics that will be learn't in the upcoming school year. This makes the project something that will be helpful for the students and keeps their minds working. It will also make their school year easier since they've already learned some topics through the summer project. \\n\",\n 'Teachers also have more resources to be able to produce summer projects for students to keep them engaged. ',\n \"Many teachers attend workshops and meetings to learn about ways to make their lessons better. This gives them immense amounts of resources they could use to put together helpful summer projects. They also have connections to other teachers and programs that students don't have the access to. These connections are important since they provide useful information. With that said, teachers would produce better summer projects than students would. \",\n 'Finally, teachers have more experience when it comes to designing projects ',\n 'A big part of a teachers jobs is to create projects and worksheets for their students all year long. This gives them experience regrading what the students will enjoy and how to plan the projects. They would also know how to assure that the students are learning but in a fun way based off their experience. Teachers go through college to learn all this, so they have a lot of experience and a good understanding of what projects should entail. ',\n 'However, some might say students should be able to design the summer projects because they are the ones that have to do it ',\n 'It is true that students are the ones that have to complete the projects but the teachers know what will be better for the students to help benefit them ',\n 'For example, a student might create a project where they have to play video games. This would not benefit the students in anyway since they will not be learning anything ',\n 'Therefore, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know the content, have more resources and have more experience to assure that students continue learning during their break.\\xa0 ',\n 'Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great place to help with horses, young cows, and mules ',\n 'You can travel the world and see places like China, Europe, Greece, and Italy.

The summer sees,the mental maturation of many students without the hindrance of a classroom,holding them back. The learning experience offered in a classroom setting is limited only to what the teacher and state permits. Students are not fully able to express their learning passions because they are forced to learn what the teacher permits. Whereas, during the summer students are free to conduct their own personal investigations on topics that peak their interest, resulting in a much maturer student by the time fall rolls around. \",\n 'To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher. \\n',\n 'The ability for students to choose their own summer projects would enhance their outlook on education,because they would study topics that interest them,and not teacher selected topics that would seem like a task. ',\n 'It is a scientifically proven fact that students retain knowledge that speaks to their own curiosities\\xa0and that holds the most relevance to them. During the summer, many students travel to new places or try new things. For example, last summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Japan with my friends and family. While I was there I tried new cuisines,participated in festivities and I was able to learn about their history. My time in Japan, sparked an interest that I never knew I had in Japanese Geisha. I spent hours upon hours researching everything I could on them. But, my research was limited because I had to complete an AP Human Geography summer assignment administered by my future teacher. My assignment was to write a paper and create a brochure about a country. I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to write all about my trip to Japan. That is until I realized the teacher had already selected countries based on our last names. I was stuck with Great Britain, a country I already had a lot of knowledge of from history class and videos. I like many students completed the assignment without gaining any new information because doing the project felt as if it were a chore. Though,I do still remember the information I learned from conducting my own research into Geisha. ',\n 'Many teachers would argue that a student designed summer project would lack information or seem to rushed. ',\n 'Which would not be the case at all. Many students would take their time in crafting a project that meets all standards and would probably write more than what is expected, due to the project peaking their interest. Teachers would in fact, see an increase of higher marks. However, if a teacher feels that the project is not up to standards they could always low score it and have the student try again. In allowing students to design their own project teachers will receive projects that exceed all requirements due to the students behind the projects being interested in what they were learning. ',\n 'If students were able to create their own summer projects, the result would be a more creative,responsible and independent thinking person ',\n \"Teacher designed projects allow no room for creativity nor responsibility because there are guidelines and an examples set in place by the teacher,students have to follow. Thus, resulting in one hundred or more projects that all sound the same and lack any indication of the student's voice. \",\n 'Teachers would argue that summer projects must be designed by them, so that all students are able to receive full credit. ',\n 'Which is great in theory,but not in the long run. It does not benefit the student to have a guideline or rubric, it only benefits the teacher because the projects would be easier to grade. ',\n \"In the future, once students start working, supervisors will not give them examples of how to properly execute a project. For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites. Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all. She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfy\\xa0her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts. Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects. \",\n 'Students should have the ability to create their own summer assignments because it would promote mental and educational growth that would otherwise be hindered in a classroom setting. Summer break allows students to embark on new experiences that can further expand their knowledge on topics that interest them. It would also allow more time for students to develop their ideas for the project. Which would strengthen their creativity and responsibility skills. Student designed projects would help grow character.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 ',\n 'People have studied the many planets in our solar system and are fastinated by them. People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us. One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms. However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid. Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned. ',\n 'The cost and risk of exploring Venus is not worth the infromation we would achieve. ',\n 'Venus has a enviorment of very dangerous elements that can harm many living organisms and even nonliving objects ',\n 'According to the article, 97 percent of the atmosphere of Venus is carbon dioxide, which is unable to be breathed by humans. Another detail the article states is that on the surface of the planet, the average temperatures is over eight hundred degrees. The climate and enviorment of Venus is too dangerous for exploration. The planet does not hold nowhere near a safe enviorment for people or even machine. ',\n 'Another detail about Venus is that no spacecfaft has made a journey back from the planet.

Venus is too dangerous to explore and it is a waste to even send a spacecraft. The spacecrafts cost a good amount of money to make and for them to be wasted on a inhospitable planet is not worth the information we would achieve. \\n',\n 'NASA has came up with a ¨solution¨ of the problemof gaining knowledge of Venus which is for a vehicle to hover over Venus and scientists would safely observe the planet that way. ',\n 'However, the article says that this can only give us a limited amount of information on Venus since the planet has a very dense atmosphere. The effort of creating a vehicle to hover the planet only to gain bits of knowledge is redundant and is not going the benefit anyone´s cause. \\n',\n 'Venus is not worth the time, effort and resources to explore. The planet proves to be too dangerous for mankind and even for machines. Curiosity is not sufficiant enough of a reason to explore and learn about a inhospitable planet unless it is going to benefit mankind more than what it costed to gain that information.

For instance better facial recognition security systems so it can be more accurate reading faces and does not open or let in anyone that looks like the person.

Knowing when a person is feeling sad, angry, happy, etc, can really be great for if they need someone to talk to. It could make things better or make things not so good. Just having those options of emotions to be recognized is something very amazing. Even though this system can't contol your emotions or thoughts, it can really help to understand when there is something good or bad going on. \",\n 'I think another use for this could be in hospitals to detect if a patient is lying about their emotions.

All of humans show the same facial expressions but maybe some at different times. The Mona Lisa demonstration is intened to bring a smile to our face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. ',\n \"Is getting emotional facial recognization the best way to go with technology? Computers are getting smarter and it doesn't sound like it will be slowing down any time soon. When scientests and computer programers combine it can be a beautiful thing. Scientests are developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate. With new encoding and development of software scientests have now created a way for a computer to tell how someone is feeling by using their facial muscles. \",\n 'The new programing will be a positive thing, ',\n 'muscles in the face just act naturally ',\n 'the encoding is complex ',\n 'the new technology could be coming to local classrooms.

All of the muscle units that work together as one is called an \"action unit.\" Since all facial emotions are universal the technology could go worldwide once improved. The software could also identify mixed emotions. The technology reads how major muscles move and show emotion. With each emotion that is showed they compare it to a neutral face. Every day humans do the same thing. Humans read the face of other humans to try and tell how they are feeling. If they are sad or happy. There are six major emotions within the technology right now, there maybe more encoded at a later date. ',\n 'With the new technology comes new computers. ',\n \"A home PC could not take the proper encoding right now. The scientests are working on something much better to try and get the home PC's to where they can encode them. The scientests new computer software stores similar anatomical information as an electric code (D'Alto 5). Although the home PC couldn't handle the encoding, they can give simple encoding to your home PC. The encdoing that can be given is simple instructions for differnent emotions. The simple encoding would not be able to read mixed emotions. \",\n 'The emotional facial reading could be coming to a local schools. ',\n 'The new technology would be able to tell if a student was bored, or if they got confused. Then the computer could modify the lesson for the student to help them learn better. The technology could act like an effective human instructor. Must human communication is nonverbal. Emotional communication is also nonverbal. The studesnts could improve with one on one lesson plans. The studensts could also work at their own pace and have their own personal plans.
